# Movie Search Website

This is a simple website that uses the OMDb API to allow you to search for different movies. It will display the most important info on the movies and provide reviews and a description as well, it also will have an IMDb link for all the info.


Things that need fixing:
* The cards that hold all the information on the movies need a better method to calculate the size of the card, because sometimes it won't work nicely with certain movie cover sizes.
* Need to adjust the responsiveness of the website so that cards don't overlap (on certain display sizes) when you search for a movie
